  "steps": [
    "Comparison: Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements in the array and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.",
    "Iteration: The algorithm repeats the comparison and swapping process for each pair of adjacent elements in the array, starting from the beginning.",
    "Passes: Each pass of the algorithm moves the largest unsorted element to its correct position at the end of the array.",
    "Repeat: Steps 1 to 3 are repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted."
