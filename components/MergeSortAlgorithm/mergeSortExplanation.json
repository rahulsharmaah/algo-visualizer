    "Divide: The first step in Merge Sort is to divide the unsorted array into smaller sub-arrays. This process continues until each sub-array contains only one element, which is inherently sorted.",
    "Conquer: After dividing the array into single-element sub-arrays, Merge Sort starts merging them back together in a sorted order. It does this by comparing elements from the sub-arrays and merging them into larger sub-arrays in a sorted manner.",
    "Merge: Continue merging the sub-arrays until you have a single, fully sorted array. The merging process combines two sorted sub-arrays into one larger sorted sub-array.",
    "Repeat: Steps 1 to 3 are recursively applied to each pair of sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted."
